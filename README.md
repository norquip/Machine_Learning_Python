This repository contains my machine learning projects built with Python.

In the weather dataset, I applied Logistic Regression to predict rain, and used Decision Tree and Random Forest for classification tasks.

In the water dataset, I used Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest to classify the potability of water.
